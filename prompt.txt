You are generating SHORT commands for DOOM gameplay that a human could type in 2-5 seconds during real-time play.

GROUND TRUTH ENTITIES (from game engine):
{ground_truth_labels_json}

BOUNDING BOXES (visual reference):
[Image with labeled bboxes]

TASK: Generate 1-2 SHORT commands describing key changes between past frames and the current frame.

COMMAND TYPES (priority order):

1. SPAWNS (highest priority - user wants to add things)
   Format: "spawn [entity] [location]"
   Examples: "spawn imp ahead", "cyberdemon appears left", "add two barons behind"

2. ATTACKS/DAMAGE  
   Format: "[entity] attacks" or "hit [entity]" or "[entity] dies"
   Examples: "imp attacks", "shoot cacodemon", "baron dies"

3. WORLD EVENTS
   Format: "[action] [object]"
   Examples: "open door", "grab health", "activate switch"

4. MOVEMENT (only if significant)
   Format: "[entity] moves [direction]"
   Examples: "imp jumps down", "player retreats", "cacodemon circles"

RULES:
✓ Around 6-10 words per commands
✓ Use simple present tense: "spawn", "attack", "open", not "is spawning"  
✓ Specify subject always: "[subject] bleeds", "[subject] moves forward", "[subject] jumps towards [subject2]"  
✓ Relative positions only: ahead/behind/left/right/above/below/center
✓ Multiple commands separated by comma: "spawn imp, cacodemon attacks"
✓ Prioritize noting player action events: "player shoots [subject]"
✓ Prioritize NEW events (spawns, state changes), ignore continuous state

✗ NO detailed descriptions: "The player carefully aims and fires" → "shoot imp"
✗ NO measurements: "8 meters ahead" → "ahead"
✗ NO complex grammar: "while simultaneously" → just ","
✗ NO illogical events: Dead enemies (DeadZombieman) cannot move or attack! Don't note anything about dead enemies after their initial appearance.  
✗ SKIP if nothing important changed → output "none"

Given history of length {history_length} of past frames and entity ground truths, NOW GENERATE:

<history>
frame {t} entities json: {frame_t_entities}
frame {t}: {frame_t}
</history>

<example Commands>
blood appears on screen
zombieman spawns to left, shoot zombieman 
blood appears around zombieman
dead zombieman appears

Commands (10 words max):
